- ### Fluo-for-Rhino {df47bd45-3187-4912-8324-4b2288908bb8}.zip 
   A Rhino plugin that bundles all the custom commands from this repository into a ready-to-use package â€” simply download, unzip, and place it in the correct folder.
  
- ### template_cmd.py
  A template file for creating a custom Rhino command in Python to be executed directly from the Rhino command line.

- ### allPointsOn_cmd.py
  A custom Rhino command to merge the functionality of **_PointsOn** and **_SolidPtOn**.<br>
  Tested on Rhino v7 on MacOS 14.2.1 and Rhino v8 on Windows 11.

- ### restoreView_cmd.py
  A command to restore the named view tied to the active viewport by sharing the same name.
  Ideal for reverting to a saved state after temporarily modifying a view while working on the model.
  If the active viewport is a default view, the command takes no action.<br>
  Tested on Rhino v7 on MacOS 14.2.1 and Rhino v8 on Windows 11.

- ### objectsByLayer_cmd.py
  A command to set the properties of the selected object to "By Layer".<br>
  Targeted properties: Object Color, Material, Linetype, Print Color, and Print Width.<br>
  Tested on Rhino v7 on MacOS 14.2.1 and Rhino v8 on Windows 11.
  
- ### urlUpdateAliases_cmd.py
  A quick way to offload and then re-import all Rhino aliases from the latest version of [rhinoAliases.txt](/aliases/rhinoAliases.txt).<br>
  Requires IronPython 3 (urllib2). :warning:<br>
  Tested on Rhino v7 on MacOS 14 and Rhino v8 on Windows 11.

- ### namedViewPerspective_cmd.py
  A command to temporarily switch the current view to a Perspective view, making it easier to orbit and navigate for an improved modeling experience.
  Use the [restoreView (rv)](/commands/restoreView_cmd.py) command to return to the previous Named View state. <br>
  Tested on Rhino v8 on Windows 11.

- ### moveVertical_cmd.py
  A command to improve the Move Vertical workflow by preventing Project snap interference when executing the command. <br>
  Tested on Rhino v7 on MacOS 14 and Rhino v8 on Windows 11.

- ### dupAllBorder_cmd.py
  A custom Rhino command to merge the functionality of 'DupBorder and 'DupFaceBorder. <br>
  It does not support the preselection of Brep faces. :warning:<br>
  Tested on Rhino v7 on MacOS 14 and Rhino v8 on Windows 11.

- ### centerOsnapToggle_cmd.py
    A command to toggle the **Center** object snap on and off in Rhino. <br>
    This provides a quick way to enable or disable snapping to the center of circles and arcs during modeling.

   The command modifies the targeted osnap setting using **bitwise operations** to preserve the state of other active osnaps.

   #### List of osnap values:
   ```
   0           None  
   2           Near  
   8           Focus
