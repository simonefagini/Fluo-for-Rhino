- ### Fluo-for-Rhino {df47bd45-3187-4912-8324-4b2288908bb8}.zip 
   A Rhino plugin that bundles all the custom commands from this repository into a ready-to-use package ‚Äî simply download, unzip, and place it in the correct folder.
  
- ### template_cmd.py
  A template file for creating a custom Rhino command in Python to be executed directly from the Rhino command line.

- ### allPointsOn_cmd.py
  A custom Rhino command to merge the functionality of **_PointsOn** and **_SolidPtOn**.<br>
  Tested on Rhino v7 on MacOS 14.2.1 and Rhino v8 on Windows 11.

- ### restoreView_cmd.py
  A command to restore the named view tied to the active viewport by sharing the same name.
  Ideal for reverting to a saved state after temporarily modifying a view while working on the model.
  If the active viewport is a default view, the command takes no action.<br>
  Tested on Rhino v7 on MacOS 14.2.1 and Rhino v8 on Windows 11.

- ### objectsByLayer_cmd.py
  A command to set the properties of the selected object to "By Layer".<br>
  Targeted properties: Object Color, Material, Linetype, Print Color, and Print Width.<br>
  Tested on Rhino v7 on MacOS 14.2.1 and Rhino v8 on Windows 11.
  
- ### urlUpdateAliases_cmd.py
  A quick way to offload and then re-import all Rhino aliases from the latest version of [rhinoAliases.txt](/aliases/rhinoAliases.txt).<br>
  Requires IronPython 3 (urllib2). :warning:<br>
  Tested on Rhino v7 on MacOS 14 and Rhino v8 on Windows 11.

- ### namedViewPerspective_cmd.py
  A command to temporarily switch the current view to a Perspective view, making it easier to orbit and navigate for an improved modeling experience.
  Use the [restoreView (rv)](/commands/restoreView_cmd.py) command to return to the previous Named View state. <br>
  Tested on Rhino v8 on Windows 11.

- ### moveVertical_cmd.py
  A command to improve the Move Vertical workflow by preventing Project snap interference when executing the command. <br>
  Tested on Rhino v7 on MacOS 14 and Rhino v8 on Windows 11.

- ### dupAllBorder_cmd.py
  A custom Rhino command to merge the functionality of 'DupBorder and 'DupFaceBorder. <br>
  It does not support the preselection of Brep faces. :warning:<br>
  Tested on Rhino v7 on MacOS 14 and Rhino v8 on Windows 11.

- ### centerOsnapToggle_cmd.py
    A command to toggle the **Center** object snap on and off in Rhino. <br>
    This provides a quick way to enable or disable snapping to the center of circles and arcs during modeling.

   The command modifies the targeted osnap setting using **bitwise operations** to preserve the state of other active osnaps.

   #### List of osnap values:
   ```
   0           None  
   2           Near  
   8           Focus  
   32          Center  
   64          Vertex  
   128         Knot  
   512         Quadrant  
   2048        Midpoint  
   8192        Intersection  
   0x20000     End (or 131072)  
   0x80000     Perpendicular (or 524288)  
   0x200000    Tangent (or 2097152)  
   0x8000000   Point (or 8388608)
   ```
   Tested on Rhino v7 on MacOS 14 and Rhino v8 on Windows 11.

- ### keep_cmd.py
  A command to randomly keep a user-defined percentage of pre-selected objects in Rhino, useful for quick decimation and random sampling.<br>
  Tested on Rhino v8 on Windows 11.<br>

- ### axo_cmd.py
  Python script for Rhino that deforms selected objects into axonometric projections based on customizable rotation angles.<br>
  Data is preserved as object attributes for an undestructive workflow,  with full block compatibility.<br>
  The 'deaxo' command reverts objects to their original condition.<br>

   This command was inspired and made possible by this [old pdf](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/enac/atelier-maquettes/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Creating-an-Axonometric-View-in-Rhino-1.pdf) from *EPFL Lausanne*.<br>
   If you prefer the **macro**, you can copy/paste from below.<br>

   ```plaintext
   ! _Select _Pause _SetActiveViewport Top _Rotate 0 30 _SetActiveViewport Right _Shear w0 w0,0,1 -45       _SetActiveViewport Top _Zoom _All _Extents
   ```
   Tested on Rhino v8 on Windows 11.<br>

- ### deaxo_cmd.py
  Companion command to revert axonometrically projected objects back to their original condition with a single click.<br>
  Maintains all object properties while removing projection transformations, keeping your Rhino workflow seamless and non-destructive.<br>
  Written to be used in documents where the "axo" command has previously been executed. :warning:<br>

   If you prefer the **macro**, you can copy/paste from below.<br>

   ```plaintext
   ! _Select _Pause _Right _SetActiveViewport Right _Shear w0 w0,0,1 +45 _Top _SetActiveViewport Top _Rotate 0 -30       _Perspective _SetActiveViewport Perspective _Zoom _All _Extents

   ```
   Tested on Rhino v8 on Windows 11.<br>

## Adding Fluo-for-Rhino
### Rhino for Windows
To add the full bundle of **Fluo-for-Rhino** to your Windows environment, download the .zip file, unzip it, and add the main folder to:

```plaintext
C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\McNeel\Rhinoceros\8.0\Plug-ins\PythonPlugins\
```
üí° **NOTE**: If you already have an older bundle version, replace the existing folder with the new one.

### Rhino for Mac
To add the full bundle of **Fluo-for-Rhino** to your Mac OS environment, download the .zip file, unzip it, and add the main folder to:

```plaintext
