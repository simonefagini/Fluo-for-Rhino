- ### importLayerStructure.py
  A simple script to import the layer structure (name, childs, color, visible, locked) from one Rhino file to the active one.
  Tested on Rhino v8 on Windows 11.

## Running Scripts
You can launch the command `EditPythonScript`, open your script.py and then launch it from there.
Alternatively, if you frequently use the script, you can assign it to an alias to make it faster to load.
