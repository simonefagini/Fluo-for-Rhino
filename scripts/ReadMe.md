- ### importLayerStructure.py
  A simple script to import the layer structure (name, childs, color, visible, locked) from one Rhino file to the active one. <br>
  Tested on Rhino v8 on Windows 11.

- ### objects2sublayers.py
  A script to divide multiple instances of the same named block into a user-defined number of groups, organizing them into sublayers under a user-specified parent layer. <br>
  This is especially useful for subtly varying materials or colors across groups while maintaining overall block consistency. <br>
  Tested on Rhino v8 on Windows 11.

- ### initializeFluo4Rhino.rvb
  Launched at Rhino start up via idle (_options), launches **Fluo_cmd.py** to initialize the Rhino Python Engine. <br>
  Tested on Rhino v8 on Windows 11.

## Running Scripts
You can launch the command `EditPythonScript`, open your script.py and then launch it from there.
Alternatively, if you frequently use the script, you can assign it to an alias to make it faster to load.
